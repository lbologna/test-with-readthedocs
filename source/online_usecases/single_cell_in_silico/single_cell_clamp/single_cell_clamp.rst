Single cell *in silico* experiments under current/voltage clamp
###############################################################

The *Single cell in silico experiments under current/voltage clamp* Use Case 
provides Web UI to access **Neuron as a Service** in order to load the single 
cell models and run model simulations.

#. This Use Case can be found in the *Online Use Cases/Single Cell In Silico Experiments*:

#. When you arrive at the *Single cell in silico experiments under current/voltage clamp* Use Case
   you can select the single cell model from the HBP data:

     .. image:: images/single_cell_in_silico_select.png
        :width: 700px

#. As a result, the single cell model will open in a new Browser window within the
   **Neuron as a Service** web application. The following screenshot of the app is annotated with
   red text to guide you through the interface:

        :width: 700px

#. Cell morphology can be visualized either in 3D view or 2D Dendrogram view. It is possible to
   zoom/rotate/pan using your mouse/scroll wheel/trackpad.

#. Current clamp can be attached to any section by clicking the segment in the cell 3D/2D Dendrogram
   view and then pressing the *Place current injection* button, or by selecting the section in the
   tree view on the right and pressing the same button.

#. To run the simulation, switch to the **Simulation** tab. In this view, you can click
   and select the segments to record the voltage from. They are added to the corresponding list. Up to
   10 segments can be recorded from.

#. The graph showing the traces recorded from the cell segments can be zoomed in by clicking and dragging
   in order to select the area to zoom in. Double click on the graph will restore the original zoom level.

#. The recorded traces can be downloaded as csv file. The download link is available at the
   bottom right corner of the graph after the simulation has finished.

   The following jupyter notebook code shows how it can be loaded with pandas for the further analysis:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        import pandas as pd
        %matplotlib inline
        df = pd.read_csv('sim_CA1_int_bAC_011023HP2_20170510120324_2017-06-21_14-36-10_amp-soma_0-0.7nA.csv')
        df.plot.line(x='time', y='soma[0]_0')

#. In order to initialize simulation parameters with certain values it is possible to append the application
   URL with, for example, the following:
   ``?delay=0&vinit=-86&dt=.025&amp=0&hypamp=0&tstop=500&delay=100&dur=800&celsius=37``

#. If the model folder contains file named :file:`traces.dat` containing experimental traces in the following format:

    .. sourcecode:: text

        time,soma[0]_0_exp,soma[0]_1_exp,soma[0]_2_exp,soma[0]_3_exp,soma[0]_4_exp,soma[0]_5_exp
        0.004,-87.179,-87.136,-86.605,-86.825,-86.453,-85.763
        0.044,-87.249,-87.053,-86.521,-86.863,-86.425,-85.787
        0.084,-87.254,-87.013,-86.503,-86.861,-86.445,-85.776

   Then traces from this file will be loaded after the simulation completes, and in addition to the simulation
   traces. If trace names following the naming convention: ``SECTION\_SEGMENTINDEX\_ANYNAME`` then the
   corresponding segment will be highlighted when user hovers the mouse over the trace.

#. If the model folder contains file named :file:`synapses_meta.json` in the following format:

    .. sourcecode:: json

        {
            "exc": ["AMPANMDA_EMS"],
            "inh": ["GABAAB_EMS"]
        }

   Then those channel mechanisms will be visualized on the morphology with the corresponding coloring for
   excitatory and inhibitory.

#. If you have spines modeled as additional sections, it is assumed that they are constructed from a single
   segment. They will also be correctly positioned and visualized on the morphology.
