Optimise a striatial fast-spiking interneuron
#############################################

This Use Case demonstrates how BluePyOpt can be used to optimize a striatal 
fast-spiking interneuron. The notebook is self-contained and runs a few steps 
of the genetic optimization. For a production run, the population size as well 
as the number of iterations need to be increased as commented in the notebook.

The notebook starts by downloading the relevant code from the Collab storage 
and setting up the simulation and graphical environment. Since we are using 
Neuron, we also need to compile the channel mod files.

The information about the optimization to be run is stored in `config/` 
directory:

- `protocols.json`
- `features.json`
- `mechanisms.json`
- `parameters.json` and `parameters-demo.json`

For each set of parameters to be tested a neuron model is instantiated by the 
`evaluator`. A series of current injections is sent to the neuron while 
recording the somatic voltage. A number of features are extracted from this 
voltage trace, and compared to the same features extracted from the 
corresponding experimental data.

`protocols.json` lists the protocols and the associated stimuli. Each protocol 
also specifies a holding current. The delay, amplitude, duration and total 
duration are specified for each current injection.

`features.json` lists the features. Each protocol has its own set of features. 
For each feature the mean value and standard deviation (SD) are specified. 
The SD is used when weighting the feature scores together to get the final 
score for the model. Each feature also has a set of modifying parameters.

`mechanisms.json` lists the mechanisms. Each ion channel has a corresponding 
mod file which is compiled by nrnivmodl.

`parameters.json` lists all the model parameters. These can either be 
specified as a value, or as a range, by giving its upper and lower bounds.
  

Morphology of the neuron is located in `morphology/` directory:

- `morphology/BE37A-rep-cor-reg15.swc`

The optimization phase is followed by the post optimization analysis within
the same notebook.  The script plots the evolution of the error scores
with successive iterations of the genetic algorithm (generations).

It displays the top ten individuals with the best scores and lists
the feature names.

It also displays the simulated protocols (blue) overlaid on the
experimental data (grey) for the best individual.

Finally, errors for each feature of the best individual are shown and
also a mean error score is calculated. Typically, the mean score is about
3 standard deviations.

It is possible to inspect any of the 10 candidate individuals as shown above
for the best individual. Corresponding instructions are given in the
notebook.
