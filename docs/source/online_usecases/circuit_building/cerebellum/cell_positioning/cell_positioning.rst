This Use Case places cerebellar neurons (different types: specific simplified 
geometric features with anisotropic properties and specific density) into a 
layered-volume of the cerebellum.
This Use Case can be found in
*Online Use Cases/Circuit Building/Cells placement/Rat cerebellum volume*.

Approach: the desired number of cells are progressively placed following a 
random direction from the previous cell with a distance step guaranteeing that
they do not overlap. A “reset” starting point occurs when the entire
surrounding is occupied. This algorithm is computationally efficient, which is 
fundamental for high-density volumes, but still keeps a strong random component 
to achieve a realistic distribution of the pairwise inter-neuron distances. 
The PC Layer is almost a planar grid in-between GRL and ML, with an inter-soma 
distance along the x-axis constrained by the requirement that adjacent 
dendritic trees must not overlap.

**Inputs:** by a simple GUI, the basic parameters can be entered by the user

•	Base sizes (x and z) of the cerebellar volume to be built
•	Plot option enabling
•	Save option enabling

Expert users can modify more parameters from `scaffold_params.py` 
(in `/storage`):

•	Neuron types (with ID)
•	Simplified geometric features for each neuron type: radius of the soma, and eventually dendritic field extensions (direction-dependent) if the constraints of not-overlapping cells are taken into account
•	Density for each neuron type, and eventually the ratio of the density values when compagin different types.

**Output:**

•	hdf5 matrix with 5 columns (saved in /storage)
•	Neuron ID (unique)
•	Neuron type ID (from 1 to 7)
•	3D coordinates (soma center) of each neuron (x, y, and z)

Monitoring: sparseness in the subvolume by computing the distribution of 
pairwise distances (monitoring_positioning.py in /storage)

Moreover, a 3D basic visualization is depicted (somas of each neuron, using a different color for each neuron type).


**Additional information:**

•	The whole Use Case should take about 10 minutes for a volume base of 400 x 400 µm.
•	No log in to any other computer required.
